Hi, I'm Luca Stubbe, and I'm a Computer Science: Game Design student at Cabrillo, transferring to UCSC fall 2022 to graduate spring 2024.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an aspiring game designer, and the things I do outside of my classes are largely dominated by learning different aspects of game design. I've been working on a so-far untitled
game with the help and support of my colleagues, trying to learn about all the different components of game design. The current working version of the project is on Github, and
feel free to try it out! Some things I'm working on learning right now:<br/>
:art: Spritework - I've gotten better at drawing, but animations especially take me quite a while.<br/>
:loud_sound: Sound Design - Sound effects and music! Some Foley stuff and a lot of adapative music to make the game extra immersive.<br/>
:video_game: Level Design - Making interesting levels, current focus on procedural generation for replayability.<br/>
:green_book: Machine Learning - To make a more adaptive world, although this is definitely the most difficult thing I'm experimenting with.<br/>
<br/>
I'm totally down to talk about my game, test out anything you have or collaborate on something! Feel free to reach out to me at stubbeluca@gmail.com.
